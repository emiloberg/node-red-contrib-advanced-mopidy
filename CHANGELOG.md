# node-red-contrib-mopidy changelog

## 2.0.2
Corrected screenshot in README.

## 2.0.1
Fixed bug where mopidy-out couldn't find methods if Node-RED was configured to show the admin interface anywhere else then on the root of the server (`httpAdminRoot` was set in Node-RED's `settings.js`).

## 2.0.0
Based on the idea of the v0.9.0 proof of concept but completely rebuilt to a full-fledged configurable module. Version number bumped to 2.x (and not 1.x) to denote that this is a complete rebuild and not a stable version of the 0.9.0 release.

Highlights are:

* Allows connections to multiple Mopidy servers
* Access to the full API of the connected Mopidy server
* Can open connections to a Mopidy server on demand
* Fully configurable from the UI

[Laurence](https://github.com/helgrind) gracefully transfered the npm namespace `node-red-contrib-mopidy` to this rebuilt module.
